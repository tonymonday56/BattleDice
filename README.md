In the world of gaming, copyright law protects a game's name and branding from unauthorized use. There is a Yahtzee copyright, for example, on the game's official scorecard. But the game mechanics, which can include written rules, artwork and other elements known as the 'theme' of the game, remain in the public domain.

A calculation for the probability of rolling a Yahtzee, for example, depends on the player’s strategy, level of risk acceptance, and the current state of the game. Imagine a player on the final turn of the game who is actively trying to roll a Yahtzee and nothing else. They are focused on a singular objective. But the same player in a game’s early rounds may attempt to cultivate a Large Straight and throw away a matching pair, hurting the chances of rolling a subsequent Yahtzee in the process. This more open strategy of playing the dice as they fall results in a lower Yahtzee completion rate when compared to rolling for Yahtzee or bust.

Even computers optimized for perfect play cannot reproduce motivation, intuition, or the multitude of other unique qualities that humans bring to the Yahtzee table. The conditions of the game at hand and the constitution of its players add a layer of complexity that will always affect the pure statistical Yahtzee odds. Human strategy must be considered to calculate the chances of rolling a Yahtzee, or any other scoring combination for that matter.\

The statistics assume that the player goes for the given scoring category from the first turn and does not deviate in their strategy. Otherwise, it may take longer to achieve a given score as an initial pair may be discarded to roll for something else.
